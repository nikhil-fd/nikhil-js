//🎁Polyfills  (TimeStamp 01:30:00 -- 01:40:00)
//When we access array then that array contains some method like map(), filter(), reduce() and many more.
//Why or how these method showing in browser as these method defined in Array.prototype.map,
//thats why when we use array then bydefault these method display.
//Who defined these method in Array.prototype?
//these method defined by browser's javascript engine and every browser like chrome, firefox, opera had defined,
//these method in Array.prototype except internet explore(IE) so these method won't work on IE.
//In thid scenario if we have used map() method in an array then it will work on chrome, firefox, opera but,
//when the code runs in internet explorer at that time the application will be crashed because
//internet explorer's javascript engine not define map method in Array.prototype. Then it is very riks so to avoid
//such situation we can create custom method(or we can create our own method) i.e. called "Polyfills" that will be working as map() method
//so that it can work on every browser.

//NOTE: Here i took map() method as an example but we can define all custom method like filter(), reduct() etc.
//      not only for array but also string.


//👌BEST: "this" defination👌
//💥"this" value always depends on current object and "this" value will be "current object",
// like now we are talking about which object suppose we are talking about current object i.e. "pen" then "this" value will be pen.
// suppose we are talking about samsung phone then "this" value will be samsung phoen.

//👉When we are makeing polyfills 1st we should think about that method(map/foreach/filter),
//  what it returns and what it takes as an input/argument the according start writing code.
//👉1st we should think what map() method returns and what it takes as an input/argument.
//i want to use map() it reutrn all value in a new array with multiply by 3.
//map() not mutating the original array.
//map() method takes a callback function that is user function.

//🎁forEach polyfills as nikhilForEach()🚩
//Requirement:
//forEach() gives value in without array but it returns undefined.
//forEach() takes a callback function and that callback function returns element, index, array.
