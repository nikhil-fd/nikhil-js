//ðŸš©Execution ContextðŸš©
//ðŸ‘‰Execution context means whatever Code file/Program file we have made to that code file, how js run and how js execute that code file i.e. called Execution Context.
//ðŸ‘‰JS runs that code file in 2 phase-
//    (1) Memory Creation Phase -- It allocates memory only(when when define variable) 
//    (2) Execution Phase       -- It performs all arithmatic operation (like +, -, /, *, % etc..)

//ðŸ‘‰When js code runs, actually it runs inside an excution context.There are 3 types of code created in a new execution context.
//    (1) Global Execution Context              (Global execution context created - when variable is defined globally like outside function / if any code that exist outside of the JS function)
//    (2) Function/Functional Execution Context (Each function runs within its own execution context)
//    (3) Eval Execution Context                (Optional--used in mongo db --it creates a new execution context)

//ðŸ‘‰After created global execution context the it gets store in "this" variable.
//ðŸ‘‰Keep in mind-- Browser -- Global execution context is different (it contains window object)
//                 node enviornment -- Global execution context is different
