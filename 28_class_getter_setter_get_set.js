//ğŸš©"Getter" & "Setter"
//ğŸ‘‰"getter" & "setter" is defined by using "get" & "set" keyword.
//ğŸ‘‰When we are defining getter & setter that means we are defining a method that is 
//  associated with a paritcular property of an object.

//ğŸ‘‰"get" keyword is used to get the value from database.
//ğŸ‘‰"set" keyword is used to set the value in database.

//ğŸ‘‰In get(getter) we can use "return" statement but in set(setter) don't recommend or don't use "return" statement,
//because the thing is getter is doing when we get the data from database that means it will return any data, but
//setter is set the value in database so here it is not returning any value.

//ğŸ‘‰Inside "set" keyword/setter define "value"(value-just a reference name we can give any other name also) as a parameter.
//  "set" is used to set the value that's why takeing "value" as a parameter.

//ğŸ‘‰when use get and set then automatically behind the scene property(this.username) becomes method(username()).


//ğŸ‘‰Inside "get" & "set" always use _(underscore) before properties as prefix.
//   Because _(underscore) define as private properties not local.

//ğŸ‘‰Both "get" & "set" can used also in class, function & object. 

//ğŸ’¥ERROR Explained:
//if we use get(getter) and set(setter) without using _(unerscore) meanwhile we get a error,
//i.e. callstack is exceded, why we are getting this error because in same time,
//constructor is set the value as well as get and set also set the value, whereas get only get the value,
//and set is set the value that's why we get this error. so in order to overcome this issue
//we need to define underscore before property in get and set then it will consider as a new propery/variable
//get and set the value.

//ğŸ‘ŒBenefit: "getter" & "setter" benefit is inside the class whatever value is there if somebody
//            wants to access these value they can't access directly.But without "get" & "set" method everybody
//            can access these value easily so to avoid this type of thing we can use "get" & "set" method.

//ğŸ‘ŒWhy & When we use get and set?
//Generally everyone directly get the access to acessing the property, but when you don't want to give access to everyone,
//In this situation using getter and setter directly we can't access to property but indirectly we can access propety,
//like using a new propery name and that proepty name should be prefix _(underscore)(example: _username, _password etc..).
//underscore(_) represent as private property.

class User{
    constructor(username, password){
        this.username = username
        this.password = password
    }
    get password(){
        return `${this._password.toUpperCase()}`
        //ğŸ¤š"get" is used to get the value.
    }
    set password(value){
        this._password = value
        //NOTE:
        //ğŸ¤š"set" is used to set the value. 
        //ğŸ¤škeep same name for setter properties as constructor properties.
        //ğŸ¤šwhen set the password then we need to change the properties name,
        //  just add _(underscore) before that properties so that the setter properties name will be different,
        //  but it looks like same constructor properties name.
        //ğŸ¤šif we changed the properties name in setter same changed it for getter.
        //ğŸ¤šif we keep same name then setter can't set the value because js will understand that
        //  constructor() method properties also set the value and setter also set the value. 
        //ğŸ¤šthat is why we need to chang the setter properties name because here both constructor() and setter set the value. 
    }

    get username(){
        return this._username.toUpperCase()
    }
    set username(value){
        this._username = value
    }

const UserData = new User("niil6032", "Happy@123");
